        Due: March 21, 2019                                             Started: March 19, 2019
        Credit: 10 points.
        
        Problem: Write a progam that takes in a memory blocksize from the command-line that will
        then be used to store random values of various sizes into the memory of the given blocksize
        to fill it up and then use those values to get the sum of the random values. The program
        needs to check the given blocksize to make sure it's a multple of 8, not less than or equal
        to 0, or if the memory can be allocated for it. Afterwards, it stores byte (8-bit) size integers
        in memory then finds the sum of those random integers, then it does the exact same thing for 
        half-word (16-bit), word (32-bit), and double-word (64-bit), then printing it all out.

        Solution: When the program starts it first makses sure that the currect amount of arguments
        were give, if they weren't the program prints out the proper way to use it then ends, else
        it goes through to check if the blocksize is a number and if it is if it's a muliple of 8, 
        if both are true then it checks if its a positive number, if any of these don't check it the
        program will bail out citing the specific reason. Now, the program will allocate memory to this
        new block of memory (getmemblock()) that is the size of the give number this can not work giving
        an allocation error and ending the program, after all of this is passed the program goes through
        and fills the memory block with random byte sized (char) data (loadbytedata()) then adds these
        new byte sized integers (sumbytedata()), The same is done with random 2 byte sized (short int)
        data (loadhalfwdata() & sumhalfwdata()), random 4 byte sized (int) data (loadworddata() & 
        sumworddata()), and random 8 byte sized (long long) data (loaddoublewdata() & sumdoublewdata()). 
        After all of the sums have been found it is then printed to the stderr (printresult()), the 
        memory for memory block is then released and the program ends with a EXIT_SUCCESS.

        Data-structure used: A one-dimensional array for the command line arguments and for the memory
        block.

        Accessing functions for the data structure: Standard C functions for accessing arrays and 
        malloc() to allocate the memory for the memory block array.

        Errors handled: Checks the given arguemnt to make sure it is a number, its positive and 
        that its a multiple of 8. The program also recoginzes when the memory is not able to allocate
        memory. 

        Limitations: The program does not work for any numbers at that are not multiples of 8 and at 
        782 and above double-word sum overflows.

        Acknowledgment: We wrote the program together but we had a lot of help from our classmates 
        throughout the making of it.
